981374380717551616 ;;; @samfoof @NancyPelosi That is really going to help. NRA needs to join in asking responsible gun owners to set the example. Background checks, licensing and training when purchasing a gun. No loopholes. ;;; Florida ;;; 0

Or, in other words, they only really took guns from one group. Like I said. ;;; Missouri ;;; 0

Some cops shouldn't be cops. Some gun owners shouldn't be gun owners.
