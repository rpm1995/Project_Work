Watching this presser earlier, I didn’t really care about this surgeons political opinions! I just wanted THE FACTS!!! This guy obviously not an expert on the subject, so stop using his message as if it was!!!\

Hey @KayaJones tell me again how gun control is doing here in CA...? https://t.co/1pEGHEzhy9;;;-2
Seems like a threat to steal someone’s property. Stay outta Texas pal. If you go on some peoples land it will be grounds for being shot and this tweet will be exibit #1 if you are dumb enough to try and take someone’s guns. https://t.co/gumqHOFkKs;;;-2
How about that passion you have about “securing that boarder”, you use the same damn passion and hard work on gun control??? I hope you and congress can get your act together on that too..?? #NEVERAGAIN #MSDStrong #ENOUGH @Emma4Change https://t.co/O5vIA7cnt6;;;0
Prayers up for this guy right here! I don’t know you my man but I hope you pull through. FYI this guy was accidentally shot by a woman playing around with an “unloaded” gun. This is why ignorance and guns don’t mix. Viewer discretion..Prayers?? https://t.co/ZLr0Nt5iGy https://t.co/RIXiU0RBcl;;;0
Wait, sorry, are you saying Patrick, Squidward and SpongeBob are anti-gun control? https://t.co/BylMGNYuGA;;;-2

@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Gun free zone. If there was a defensive gun weapon near by, less people may have lost their lives. Maybe all could have been saved if it wasn't a gunfreezone. More guns= less crime &amp; less killing. Those are the facts here, whenever any American city as removed gun restrictions.;;;1
I stole these words because words do matter; and its well overdue to discuss sensible gun control; and 50 years after the death of Martin Luther King, Jr, to end racial hatred and prejudice. Once we do that, there would be no need for a second amendment.\
 https://t.co/Q24CVOzmaR;;;1
@mmalcangio It’s such a far out concept to think that the more guns are around, the greater the possibility that mag be killed by a gun. ?;;;1
Just to put some input on the opinions and factual evidence being brought up. The whole purpose of etiwanda walk out is more than just gun control. I will chose not to voice my opinion on the matter here. However talking with those in charge and planning https://t.co/x1YBibpHjh;;;-2
@nytopinion @NickKristof @NickKristof Thank you for attempting to create a common sense conversation around a hot topic issue. Unfortunately, 2nd amendment folks don't want to hear about common sense gun laws. They just want to keep their guns no matter who else gets hurt. #shame;;;0
Kids these days are fighting for gun control yet they’re the ones eating tide pods and now the new trend of snorting condoms.  ?;;;1
@TaraHenderson31 @LauraLoomer Mentally ill &amp; she had a gun...so I wont apologize for my position...go back &amp; listen to one guy interviewed who wished he had had a gun. Until mental health is addressed don’t expect law abiding people to lay down their lawful guns. https://t.co/cWIXLHzRrB;;;1
@BettyBowers @DLoesch lobbies for firing squads arranged in circles. She wants squads armed but untrained with guns &amp; the targets chosen by another squad. The squad members are however all blind folded.;;;-2
@ProjectMayhem29 @EternallyNasty ACTUALLY-a lot of people knew that this was coming-the cia/fbi (especially the obama picks) use &amp; will use falseflags &amp; kill americans so they can push the gun confiscation or gun control ban-Q &amp; several other people knew it was coming-searching now for fbi/cia affiliations;;;1
@JerryMeeks68 @DonaldJTrumpJr @Philcovfefe Yes. People with guns. Crazy people without guns do way less damage. Besides. We are surrounded by pro gun states. They come in easily.;;;0
@NotARaja yep-2 of the eye witnesses lamented that they didnot have a gun to fight back but then California has STRICT gun control laws.;;;1
Also if it’s not this and it’s instead domestic violence the same principles apply and it’s a decent excuse to pay more attention to DV as a national issue while also continuing to press gun control https://t.co/1Abjjocd9Q;;;-2
My co-workers we’re discussing their photo shoot they did for their husbands featuring them in pearls, lace and guns... I felt that whole conversation in my SOUL! That’s the type of shit I fw!!;;;-2
@Philcovfefe @JerryMeeks68 @DonaldJTrumpJr I Uber. Beer gives me gout. But it’s a false equivalency. Guns have one purpose. Killing. Cars are designed to take you places. And far more people ride in cars than shoot/own guns. So yes. The numbers would be different.;;;0
@msgreenjeans @abc7newsbayarea Do you think we only want common sense gun laws for NRA members? We want gun control for everyone. This incident may not have been preventable, but others that have happened recently were.;;;0
@WarixRS @ravens1954 @rulajebreal Raising it to 21 discriminates against citizens who are in the military, police training, and who work a gun shops and gunsmiths.;;;-2
@TheDailyDish2 The point is we don’t know where or how she got the gun, and that doesn’t mean that the gun control narrative is dead.;;;-2
@TheJordanRachel More gun control isn’t the solution, LIBERAL CONTROL is what we need. ?;;;1
@thatonenerdo @AlanKin48016100 @AMarch4OurLives @YouTube My entire family conceals and carries, I don’t know why you feel scared or have the fear of getting killed, when my experience around guns are that they don’t just go off on their own like, hey a person, I’ll shoot them. People are the problem, guns aren’t.;;;1
@TheDailyDish2 I have one, it’s pretty radical. We repeal the second amendment. Crazy, right? The movement isn’t dead, it’s only just beginning. Nothing even relatively moderate has been brought forward yet, so until that point the gun control narrative will stay very much alive.;;;0
@BeuwenDragon @theRealTK @realDonaldTrump Literally the *rest of the entire world* disagrees with you.\
\
It lowers the homicide rate. \
It reduces the suicide rate. \
It reduces the accidental death rate. \
\
Peer countries with fewer guns see all these drastically lower than the US. US states too.\

https://t.co/AQQCbpiAkN;;;0
@DonaldJTrumpJr She had a gun, was the problem. Guns are the problem. And morons. Morons who support guns. And Trumps. But I repeat myself.;;;0
@emsetahrettiwt @chakmpls @SageRosenfels18 Don’t misquote me. I said that in other nations where they all have guns the crime and death rates are lower than here. That doesn’t necessarily mean EVERYONE should have a gun here.;;;0
Definition #1 of Insanity: Doing the same thing over &amp; over again while expecting a different result. Definition #2 of Insanity: Thinking there is no reason to change gun laws because criminals will still commit crimes with guns. #EndGunViolence;;;0
Is this person serious? She just killed the let's argument on guns ?? https://t.co/FyKIChG28y;;;-2
@johnpavlovitz @vancitydwell Can't we just stipulate that there are unhinged people of every political persuasion who shouldn't be allowed to own a gun?  Now let's work on ways to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.;;;0
Sidenote - Most media types and their allies who debate gun control are so misinformed it's embarrassing but they still don't mind talking about it. Discussing arguably the biggest health scrouge out there is far less comfortable and that's unacceptable.;;;-2
I also pledged never to touch a gun, even if given the chance to shoot one in a safe, presumable fun gun range. Gun regulations never advance in the name of nice people who use guns for hunting or target practice. We need to stop catering to those people.;;;0
@theresa4tgl @Veritaph @MollySam1986 @lauren_hoggs @Kelly28227 FYI, Obama gun control measure was not a law but a rule that required the Social Security Administration to report disability recipients with mental health conditions to the FBI. Obama's successor, Republican President Donald Trump, rescinded the rule in 2017.source:Tom Murse USI;;;0
You can have fun without guns. There is not a single gun (except for a dolphin) in this spoof, and I bet you won't notice  #PvZ #PvZGW #PvZGW2 https://t.co/TxmH3ZMra4;;;0
I find it funny that people back home are for gun control\

there was a shooting in San Bruno with a handgun this time, not a rifle.\

I’m pretty sure crime is the problem;;;1

They're testing Chicago. Should Chicago just fire it up or give the guns up. Mine you they are going to kill you either way. Me I'm keeping a gun https://t.co/r9mvNJRM55;;;1
@casiichandler Setting aside the philosophical and constitutional issues, why does the gun control crowd think that the government would be any better at enforcing control than it is at anything else it does?;;;1
@benshapiro Hears a crazy idea, how about universal background checks and those with "mental issues" not able to buy a gun. We can also add those no fly list people to the list of not being able to buy guns.;;;0
@canthaight They don't profit from gun control but think they'll profit (by whatever margin) w mass federal distribution of guns;;;0
Who’s ox is gored?\
This is the principal upon which conservatives base their world view.\
If it’s your ox, too bad. My ox, well now I believe in LGBT rights. Your kid shot? Crisis actor! Mine? Yes we need gun control. Understand the mindset or remain amazed by their stupidity.;;;0
You know what’s crazy? I grew up with guns around me. I have shot guns many of times. My father, a cop, owns an AR-15. Guns were very prevalent in my life. But never one time have I thought, “I think I should shoot up a school” it’s not the guns, it’s 100% mental health. https://t.co/FssPWCyS6R;;;1
@JoanSmi88333767 Japan has 127 million people and 10 gun deaths per year. The United States has 325 million people and 33,000 gun deaths per year. Something doesn't add up . . . A country that has 4% of the world's population shouldn't have 42% of the world's guns. https://t.co/RZ3k3GpdL5;;;0

@GemMar333 @Sober297 @FBI @NRA This is funny think about it he wants to kill every gun owner and NRA member but with what. His party is full of pussy hats and cross gender people who are confused about what bathroom to use and the liberal's youth want to take guns .. Tide pods dreamers ..;;;1

Seems it’s only “too soon” to talk about guns when it’s grieving families begging for change and churchgoers hiding under pews and county music fans running in plain sight and students marching for their lives. @NRA capitalized on another mass shooting ASAP tho #ParklandStrong https://t.co/3sLsDhROlO;;;0

@politicalrussef @MarxistLEO @aravosis So you're saying that if AR-15s are made illegal tomorrow (not all guns, just AR-15s or semi-auto rifles or high capacity clips) and you all have to turn them in, you're willing to kill cops to keep your gun? Or you're willing to kill US soldiers? Is THAT what you're saying?;;;0
@CurtPopejoySW @maralagosinkhol @AviAhvee @Gbnf4life If that were true the Dems would be trying to take guns, changing the second Ammendment and raising taxes! That is what the Repummunist always try to sell!;;;-2
@chase_g1 Ofcourse it does. Young kids are getting guns as gifts and everyone is okay with that ... GUNS ... why do you need a gun as a kid ..;;;0
@USSRSanctions @bennyjohnson Let me come at you. Mentality ill folks are the shooters. One of the kills with a gun, ban guns. Normal people have guns, no murders. Bc one guy kills, we punish everyone? It isn’t the tool, it is the person. If I have a gun, it is my choice to kill or not;;;1
@kellyjane821 @SavujryMagistry @lauren_hoggs So that kills the “Good guy with a gun theory” it also proves that people with guns are just as likely to be cowards as anyone else. Your gun wielding good guy is a straw man with no basis in reality.;;;1
Is that more mass shootings I hear about??\

For all those who don’t support gun control, you don’t want to stop innocent people from dying by guns? Or?? \

Just asking for a friend.;;;0
@Hogantommyhogan @shannonrwatts Wrong. NRA lobbies and buys our congress to keep the sales of guns flowing. For gun manufacturers. We follow the $$$$;;;0

The NRA knows that no one is coming to take guns. They also know that by associating any rhetoric about gun control to “thugs, extremists, and the dirty dems” you can blind a whole demographic to logical and much needed gun control. Also theyre racist, but we been knew https://t.co/xYmd0eDBv9;;;0
@michaelianblack We need to enforce the laws we have and hold law enforcement and FBI to higher standards.  Taking guns and having gun free zones is not the answer, pretty sure YouTube is a gun free zone.  Also in Chicago, is illegal to own hand guns, how is that working out?;;;0
@kiimpiink @lonelyvatos @jalatto_ @Blake82218159 @ddlovato @YouTube She doesn’t respresent all Muslims, and nobody is trying to take your guns Becky we just want stricter laws on being able to buy a gun.

what shooting?\
there was a shooting in gun control California by a leftist muslim in a gun free zone?\
Really?\
where did you hear that?;;;-2
@Frogger_Jones @adamTHX1138 @rblinne @DDHonee @cliffschecter Right, blame black people for all gun violence when most gun deaths are white men committing suicide. Because fucking morons believe buying more guns protects them from the government, so guns are everywhere. What a mess this mindset has gotten us.;;;0
@HelloimRico @quentinbaileyy Yeah except all 5 cities are right next door to cities/states that have laxed gun control laws and that's where their guns come from. Watch any doc on guns in Chicago. They come from Indiana.;;;0
PS I am all for sensible gun control as its way out of control. I am  also all for loving each other unconditionally (&amp; feel that would b at least as helpful as gun control).The main fear on other side is All guns being taken away. Assurances to the contrary would go a Long way.;;;0
